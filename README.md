## üöÄ About the Project

The **AirBnB Clone Project** simulates the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development with particular emphasis on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables understanding of complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

### Project Goals

- Implement secure user management systems
- Develop comprehensive property management features
- Create an efficient booking system
- Integrate payment processing capabilities
- Design a user-friendly review system
- Optimize data retrieval and storage
- Apply industry-standard security practices
- Establish CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment

## ‚ú® Features

### User Management

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Django**: High-level Python web framework
- **Django REST Framework**: Tools for building RESTful APIs
- **GraphQL**: Flexible query language for API operations
- **Celery**: Asynchronous task queue for background processing

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database for data storage
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store for caching and session management

### DevOps
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow automation

### Security
- JWT Authentication
- HTTPS/SSL encryption
- Data validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and request throttling

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture with separate components for:
- Authentication service
- Property management service
- Booking service
- Payment service
- Review service
- Notification service

Each service is containerized using Docker and communicates through RESTful APIs and message queues.
